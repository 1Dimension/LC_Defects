# LC_Defects

This C++ code is designed to analyze defect structures in liquid crystals under confinement, based on the Landau-de Gennes free energy framework, using a 'discrete-then-minimize' strategy.

Primarily, the code is for the simulations in the following study:

Noh, J., Wang, Y., Liang, H. L., Jampani, V. S. R., Majumdar, A., & Lagerwall, J. P. (2020). The paper, titled "Dynamic tuning of the director field in liquid crystal shells using block copolymers," was published in Physical Review Research (Vol. 2, Issue 3, Article 033160). It explores the behavior of nematic liquid crystals confined within a spherical shell.

Additionally, this code is applicable to simulations described in the paper

Wang, Y., Zhang, P., & Chen, J. Z. (2017). Their paper, "Topological defects in an unconfined nematic fluid induced by single and double spherical colloidal particles," appears in Physical Review E (Vol. 96, Issue 4, Article 042702). This research investigates nematic liquid crystals confined externally to two spheres.
