# LC_Defects

[The code is still under construction]

Please email yiweiw@ucr.edu if you have any questions.

This C++ code is designed to simulate defect structures in liquid crystals under confinement, based on the Landau-de Gennes free energy framework, using a 'discrete-then-minimize' strategy.

Primarily, the code is for the simulations in the following study:

Additionally, this code applies to simulations in the paper with a slight modification.
